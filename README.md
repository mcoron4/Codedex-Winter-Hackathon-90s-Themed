My project is about re-creating what a web page might have looked like if the Taxi companies decided to try and create an Uber in the 90s! I decided to re-create the current Uber landing page, but add some 90s flare to it.



I chose colors that match the classic taxi color scheme (yellow, black, white)
I added a Mapquest map image since that was used in the 90s instead of a modern map image
When you click the "see price" you do not begin the ride booking process. You actually just see a 90s pop up window asking to call to book... like a typical taxi service
The shortest pickup time is 45min ... typical taxi service!
Added some additional 90s aesthetics (flashing words, under construction text, NetScape banner, and visitor counter number


I chose Replit for my IDE so I could iterate quickly and CSS/HTML/JS. The biggest challenge I faced is I had to quickly learn CSS/HTML/JS using Codedex! It was my first time trying to use them. I only have beginner knowledge of Java and C.
